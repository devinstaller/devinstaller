#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
#+END_SRC

More instructions on their Github repository.

* Develop

Before you git push a new module make sure unit tests are also
included. Test are to be written using ~pytest~.

For more information look into [[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/test-driven-development-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not-41fa6bca02a2/][Test Driven Development]].

** For developers install normal and dev dependencies

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
poetry install
#+END_SRC

** Use poetry shell

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
poetry shell
#+END_SRC

** Install normal dependencies

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
poetry add numpy
#+END_SRC

** Install dev dependencies

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
poetry add -D pytest
#+END_SRC
* Testing and code coverage

** Testing

Install [[https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][tox]] on your machine globally or in a separate venv, then run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
tox
#+END_SRC

** Coverage report

Coverage report is automatically generated for the master branch by [[https://coveralls.io/gitlab/justinekizhak/devinstaller][coveralls.io]]

* Testing using Gitlab runner locally

** Prerequisites

*** Docker
You need docker installed, because we will be using the =docker= executor for the gitlab-runner.

** Install =gitlab-runner= locally

*** MacOS

**** Install using brew

#+BEGIN_SRC
brew install gitlab-runner
#+END_SRC

**** Register it with gitlab

#+BEGIN_SRC
gitlab-runner register
#+END_SRC

**** Options

| Option                  | Value                               |
|-------------------------+-------------------------------------|
| =gitlab-ci coordinator= | https://gitlab.com                  |
| =gitlab-ci description= | Enter some description              |
| =gitlab-ci tags=        | Enter some tags                     |
| =Executer=              | =docker=                            |
| =default docker image=  | Enter the name of some docker image |

** Running the tests

#+begin_src
gitlab-runner exec docker test
#+end_src

* Facing any problems

** Issue with installing poetry packages

Try setting LANG variable for the shell, if its not set.

*** Copy paste this line into your =~/.bash_profile= or =~/.zshrc=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
export $LANG = en_US.UTF-8
#+END_SRC

After this you might need to reopen the terminal.

*** Reinstall Python using brew

The default python installation from Xcode is not built using SSL support. So
you may have problem installing packages.

Reinstall python using this command on the terminal:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew reinstall python
#+END_SRC

* Git

This project uses the [[https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/][Conventional git commit specs]].

[[https://devinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Read the docs]]

* Changelog

Changelog is generated using =git-chglog=. See [[https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog][git-chglog]].

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git-chglog -o CHANGELOG.md
#+END_SRC

* Versioning

This project uses [[https://semver.org/][Semver versioning]].

Version management is done using =poetry=.
